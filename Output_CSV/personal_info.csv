5,Eesha Sharma,MoGen,Stanford University,CEO & Founder at MoGen,MoGen,879,"My mind was captivated by the prospect of hacking biology ever since I first heard about bioengineers creating glow-in-the-dark cats using jellyfish proteins back in 2004. Currently, I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow at Stanford University and co-Founder of an early stage biotech start-up, MoGen - currently in stealth mode. I developed a deep understanding of molecular biology and biochemistry during my PhD in Molecular Genetics at the University of Toronto. I was fortunate to begin my PhD at a time where the technology to sequence millions of RNA and DNA molecules had just taken off. Combining the leading expertise of my lab in RNA biology and high-throughput sequencing technology, I developed one of the first methods to profile RNA-RNA interactions in the cell on a global scale. This work led to a publication in the top 5% of research outputs scored for attention and impact by Altmetric (https://dimensionsplus.altmetric.com/details/7363185) While creating research tools during my PhD was highly satisfying, I became thirsty for an application of my skills to help people in a tangible, direct and positive way. This is what led to my move to Stanford where science, business and computer science fostered a powerful birthing ground for our start-up. At MoGen we are always interested in discussing our work and recruiting talented individuals passionate about being a part of the future of clinical genetics.
